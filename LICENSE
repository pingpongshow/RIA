## ENCRYPTION NOTICE

This Software includes AES-256 encryption capabilities.

### IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE:

1. **Amateur Radio Regulations**: Many jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the use of encryption on amateur radio frequencies. In the United States, FCC Part 97.113(a)(4) generally prohibits messages encoded for the purpose of obscuring their meaning on amateur frequencies. Check your local regulations before enabling encryption.

2. **Export Controls**: Encryption software may be subject to export control regulations including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Users are responsible for compliance with all applicable export laws and regulations.

3. **Lawful Use Only**: The encryption features are intended for lawful purposes such as:
   - Testing and development on closed systems
   - Use on frequencies where encryption is permitted
   - Emergency communications where authorized
   - Non-RF loopback testing

4. **No Warranty of Security**: While AES-256 is a strong encryption standard, no guarantee is made regarding the security or suitability of this implementation for any particular purpose.

**By using the encryption features, you accept sole responsibility for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.**
